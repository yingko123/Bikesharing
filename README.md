## Summary:
From the analysis, we can conclude that the CitiBike service enjoys high demand during weekday rush hours. In addition, there is also good demand during the day on the weekend.<br>

Some further analysis ideas are: 
* Rides by Age & Gender - this can help us project demands based on local population age distribution.

* Starting Station Location in relationship to Ride Duration - this can help us understand factors affecting ridership by location.
