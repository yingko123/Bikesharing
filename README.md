# New York City Bike Share Analysis

## Overview:
We will use Tableau to display our analysis of the bike share services offered by CitiBike.  

## Results:
Using CitiBike ride data from August 2019, we conducted analysis of the bike sharing service and summarized our results in this [Tableau story (NY CitiBike Analysis)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ying.ko5568/viz/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_16621374036050/NYCitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes).

## Summary:
From the analysis, we can conclude the CitiBike service enjoy high demand during weekday rush hours.  In addition, there is also good demand during the weekend as a "fun" activity.

Some further analysis ideas are: 
* Rides by Age & Gender - this can help us project demands based on local population age distribution.

* Starting Station Location in relationship to Ride Duration - this can help us understand factors affecting ridership by location.
